      "<p><a href='https://financialmodelingprep.com/financial-summary/CSCO'>Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)</a> announced on Wednesday a reduction in its full-year forecast and provided weaker guidance for the current quarter, alongside revealing a restructuring plan that includes eliminating 5% of its global workforce. As a consequence, the company’s shares dropped more than 3% pre-market on Thursday.</p>\n<p>The revised full-year outlook now anticipates adjusted earnings per share (EPS) between $3.68 and $3.74, with revenue projections between $51.5 billion and $52.5 billion. This adjustment is a downturn from previous forecasts, which expected an adjusted EPS between $3.87 and $3.93 on revenue ranging from $53.8 billion to $55.0 billion.</p>\n<p>For fiscal Q2, Cisco reported an adjusted EPS of $0.87 on revenue of $12.8 billion, slightly above the expectations of analysts, who had predicted an EPS of $0.84 on revenue of $12.71 billion.</p>\n<p>The company saw a 9% year-over-year decline in product revenue, which constitutes the majority of its total revenue, while service revenue experienced a 4% increase.</p>\n<p>For the upcoming fiscal Q3, Cisco is forecasting an adjusted EPS between $0.84 and $0.86, with revenue expected to be in the range of $12.1 billion to $12.3 billion. These figures fall short of analyst expectations, which were set at an EPS of $0.91 and revenue of $13.13 billion.</p>\n",

      "<p>Morgan Stanley analysts changed <a href='https://financialmodelingprep.com/financial-summary/CLF'>Cleveland-Cliffs' (NYSE:CLF)</a> rating from Overweight to Equalweight, adjusting the price target to $20 from $21.50.</p>\n<p>The analysts explained the downgrade acknowledging Cleveland-Cliffs' potential for a strong free cash flow (FCF) yield in the upcoming years due to the absence of significant capital expenditure projects. </p>\n<p>Additionally, a considerable portion of the company's annual contracts are fixed-price, which is expected to help maintain its overall pricing in the face of anticipated declines in spot steel prices in 2024. </p>\n<p>However, Cleveland-Cliffs' significant exposure to the automotive sector, which is projected to underperform this year after a robust 2023, prompts concerns. Considering the stock's approximately 23% increase since the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2023, buoyed by successful price increases and a renewed focus on share buybacks by the management, the analysts believe the stock now lacks substantial upside potential relative to the new price target, leading to the adjustment in rating.</p>\n",

      "<p>Wells Fargo analysts raised the rating for <a href='https://financialmodelingprep.com/financial-summary/MOH'>Molina Healthcare (NYSE:MOH)</a> from Underweight to Equal Weight, with a new price target of $420. The adjustment is based on a detailed scenario analysis, considering variations in base earnings, Medicaid Request for Proposals (RFP) outcomes, and the approach to capital allocation. </p>\n<p>The analysis suggests that the market has likely accounted for some level of RFP success in Molina's stock price. Therefore, significant negative impacts would require both disappointing operational results and a lack of success in RFPs. Conversely, to achieve substantial positive movement, Molina would need to secure significant wins in RFPs. This assessment indicates that the current risk/reward profile for Molina Healthcare is considered to be well-balanced.</p>\n",
